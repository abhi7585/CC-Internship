# CC-Internship

This is my Internship work where I had to scrape the data of the College details and visualize it to get the valued information.

In this intership period I performed the following tasks:-
- Developed a program to Web Scrape the required data
- Used Beautiful Soup for scrapping data and created a CSV file of the data
- Created a dashboard using PowerBi and Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
- Drafted an SRS Document, Project Charter, Development log and RAID log
